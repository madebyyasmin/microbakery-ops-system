# Bakery Workflow — Sourdough, Cookies, Cakes & Brownies
A breakdown of how orders move from intake → planning → baking → fulfillment,
using Notion as the core operational hub.

# 1. Order Intake

## Tools:
- **Tally or Typeform** – customer order form  
- **Zapier** *(optional future automation)* – push orders into Notion  
- **Notion** – master order database  

## Workflow:
1. Customer fills out preorder form  
2. Order automatically or manually added to **Notion – Orders Database**  
3. Order assigned:
   - customer name  
   - items (sourdough/cookies/cakes/brownies)  
   - quantity  
   - pick-up or delivery window  
4. Orders labeled by **status** (New → Confirmed → In Production → Ready → Completed)

# 2. Production Planning (Notion)

## Notion Databases Used:
- **Orders**
- **Weekly Menu**
- **Production Schedule**
- **Recipe Book**

## How It Works:
- Orders sync into a **weekly view**  
- Sourdough bakes map to:
