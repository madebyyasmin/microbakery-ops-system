## 🧁 Why This Repo Exists

I'm building this as a real project and an example of:
- systems thinking  
- workflow design  
- product + creative integration  
- documentation skills  
- user flow design  

It shows I can take an idea  
→ design the product experience  
→ build the operational engine behind it.
