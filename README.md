🍞 Micro Bakery & Coffee — Operational System Design

A cozy, Notion-powered operations system for my home micro bakery project.
This repo documents how I design workflows, organize production, and build simple systems that help small ideas run smoothly — blending creative ops, product thinking, and workflow design.

It’s both a real project I’m building and a portfolio example of how I work:
systems thinking → user flows → documentation → operational clarity.

✨ What This Covers

This repo includes all the foundational building blocks for launching a small-scale bakery:

📝 Menu strategy, naming, and brand direction

☕ Customer experience + order intake flow (forms → CRM → confirmation)

🔄 Production workflow design

📦 Inventory & fulfillment processes

📊 Notion database architecture

⚙️ Automation map (current + future)

🎨 Creative considerations (mood, packaging, tone)

🌼 Why This Repo Exists

This project shows how I approach building small but scalable systems:

✔️ Clear documentation

✔️ User-friendly workflows

✔️ Practical automation

✔️ Clean handoffs & routing

✔️ Creative + operational integration

✔️ Product thinking applied to real operations

I like turning messy processes into cute, functional systems that feel good to use.
This repo shows the full thought process behind that.
